Problem statement
Write a program to compute the maximum bending moment for a simply supported beam carrying multiple point loads at different points. Allow the operator to input the loads.
 Also,
 a) Calcuate max. bending moment and req. section modulous for the cross section of beam to limit the maximum bending stress to a given level (material table given)
 b) Recommend shapes
 c) Plot graph over length
